## API Doc

**Note:** There are 2 types of users in the API. An `ADMIN`, which has access all of the users and posts in the database, and there's normal `USER`, who only has access of it's own user information and posts owned by.

**Authentication:** Every request except User Login and User Register requires authentication. In order to authenticate, HTTP header called `x-auth` must be set and sent with requests. To get the valid token, send a **POST** request to **/users/login** with user info in the body,and get the token back, which you can use for your next requests.
